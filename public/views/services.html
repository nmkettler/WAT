			<h3 class="services_individual_titles">Asbestos</h3>		

			<p>Asbestos is the name associated with six regulated mineral fibers that has been used commercially in a variety of building construction materials. Because of its high tensile strength and heat resistant properties, asbestos has been used for a wide range of manufactured goods, mostly in building materials (roofing shingles, ceiling and floor tiles, paper products, asbestos cement board(known as transite board), joint compound, window glaze and all forms of mastic), friction products (automobile clutch, brake, and transmission parts), heat-resistant fabrics, packaging, gaskets, and coatings.</p>
			
			<p>When asbestos-containing materials are damaged or disturbed by repair, remodeling or demolition activities, microscopic fibers become airborne and can be inhaled into the lungs, where they can cause significant health problems. Their are different classes of asbestos dependent on how friable a material can be made, thus affecting the severity of the removal process.</p>		
			<p>Regulations: <br>

			UsS Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA), Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA), NESHAP and Local Clean Air Agencies require that prior to any renovation/demolition/maintenance activities, all building materials must be identified for any presence of asbestos containing materials (ACM).</p>

			<h3 class="services_individual_titles">Lead</h3>		

			<p>Lead paint or lead-based paint is paint containing lead. As pigment, lead(II) chromate (PbCrO4, "chrome yellow") and lead(II) carbonate (PbCO3, "white lead") are the most common forms. Lead is added to paint to speed up drying, increase durability, maintain a fresh appearance, and resist moisture that causes corrosion. It is one of the main health and environmental hazards associated with paint. In some countries, lead continues to be added to paint intended for domestic use, whereas countries such as the U.S. and the U.K. have regulations prohibiting this, although lead paint may still be found in older properties painted prior to the introduction of such regulations. Although lead has been banned from household paints in the United States since 1978, paint used in road markings may still contain it. Alternatives such as water-based, lead-free traffic paint are readily available, and many states and federal agencies have changed their purchasing contracts to buy these instead.</p>
			
			<p>Regulatory Levels: <br>

			Lead in Paint: 1.0 mg/cm2 or 5,000 µ g/g (0.5% or 5,000ppm)</p>

			<h3 class="services_individual_titles">Mold</h3>		

			<p>Molds are a large and taxonomically diverse number of fungal species where the growth of hyphae results in discoloration and a fuzzy appearance, especially on food. The network of these tubular branching hyphae, called a mycelium, is considered a single organism. The hyphae are generally transparent, so the mycelium appears like very fine, fluffy white threads over the surface. Cross-walls (septa) may delimit connected compartments along the hyphae, each containing one or multiple, genetically identical nuclei. The dusty texture of many molds is caused by profuse production of asexual spores (conidia) formed by differentiation at the ends of hyphae. The mode of formation and shape of these spores is traditionally used to classify molds. Many of these spores are colored, making the fungus much more obvious to the human eye at this stage in its life-cycle.</p>
			
			<p>Molds are considered to be microbes and do not form a specific taxonomic or phylogenetic grouping, but can be found in the divisions Zygomycota and Ascomycota. In the past, most molds were classified within the Deuteromycota.</p>	

			<p>Molds cause biodegradation of natural materials, which can be unwanted when it becomes food spoilage or damage to property. They also play important roles in biotechnology and food science in the production of various foods, beverages, antibiotics, pharmaceuticals and enzymes. Some diseases of animals and humans can be caused by certain molds: disease may result from allergic sensitivity to mold spores, from growth of pathogenic molds within the body, or from the effects of ingested or inhaled toxic compounds (mycotoxins) produced by molds.</p>	
			<p>Regulations: <br>

			Standards or Threshold Limit Values (TLVs) for airborne concentrations of mold, or mold spores, have not been set. Currently, there are no EPA regulations or standards for airborne mold contaminants.</p>

			<h3 class="services_individual_titles">Pre-Demolition Hazardous Materials Survey</h3>		

			<p>US Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA), Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA), NESHAP and Local Clean Air Agencies require that prior to any renovation/demolition/maintenance activities, all building materials must be identified for any presence of asbestos containing materials (ACM). When completing complete demolition of a property a survey is required. The survey sample quantity is based on a case by case basis. </p>
			
			<p>Each survey will: <br></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Contain a photo log for each sample taken.</li>
				<li> A Complete sketch to document each sample location</li>
				<li>Have a completed graph containing all asbestos positive materials and square footage.</li>
				<li>Asbestos results clearly labeled by sample and by each individual layer within each sample.</li>
			</ul>
